    <h1>Cities I have lived in:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Boston, Ma</li>
        <li>Standish, Me</li>
        <li>Dedham, Ma</li>
        <li>Norwood, Ma</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Boston is the city where I was born and grew up for some of the earlier years of my life. Standish is a small
        town in Maine where SJC is and I lived for 4 years while attending undergradute. The town of Norwood is where I
        lived with my buddies from highschool after we graduated from undergrad, and lastly Dedham is the town where I
        grew up and currently reside.</p>

    <h1>Cities I would like to visit:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Augusta, Georgia</li>
        <li>St. Andrews, UK</li>
        <li>Key West, Florida</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Being a golf nut, Augusta is home of The Masters Tournament and ANCC. I have successfully not won the lottery
        for tickets the past 5 years; a respectable streak. We will make it some day! Linked to the Augusta note, St.
        Andrews is the home of golf and the old course where I would love to visit and play some day! Lastly Key West
        Florida, doesn't necessarily have golf implications but seems like a fun interactive place to visit.</p>
